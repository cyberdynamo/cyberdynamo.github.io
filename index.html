	<h2 align="middle"> <b>2. Android 11: Google makes a mistake, reveals next major Android OS version </b></h2>
	<h3> Android 11 is not a secret anymore. Google executives have already unveiled it a couple of times in the past. But this time the company dropped a major hint that Android 11 exists, by briefly publishing the Android 11 Developer Preview page on its website. Although the web page has been pulled up, Android Police was able to take a screenshot. The page clearly mentions ‘Android 11 Developer Preview’ followed by a short description:
		“Get your apps ready for Android 11, with stronger protections for user privacy, new ways to engage users, extended support for foldables, Vulkan extension and more! Try it today on any Pixel device!” </h3>
